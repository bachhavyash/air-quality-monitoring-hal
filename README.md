## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Air quality sensors continuously monitor surrounding air.
2. Sensor outputs are processed by the microcontroller.
3. Pollution levels are compared against predefined safe thresholds.
4. When unsafe levels are detected:
   - Alerts are generated to indicate hazardous conditions.
5. The system supports awareness and timely corrective actions.
